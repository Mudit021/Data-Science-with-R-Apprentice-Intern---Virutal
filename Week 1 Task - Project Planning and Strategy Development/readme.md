# Key Steps:

## 1.Define the Project Objective: 
Start by clearly outlining what you intend to achieve from the project. Identify the problem you want to solve or the question you want to answer using data science techniques in R.

## 2.Research Background: 
Provide context and rationale for selecting the project topic. Include an overview of relevant literature or previous studies.

## 3.Plan the Project Phases: 
Break down the project lifecycle into phases such as data collection (if applicable), data cleaning, analysis, model development, and reporting. Include estimated timelines for each phase.

## 4.Assign Roles and Responsibilities: 
Even if you are working alone, define the roles you will assume (analyst, programmer, project manager) and outline tasks accordingly.

## 5.Risk Management: 
Identify potential risks and propose mitigation strategies.

# Dataset used:
I am using the Facebook Dataset given by a prof. named Mr. Tushar Mahore

# About the dataset:
The original dataset is provided in a .csv format. But this dataset was totally in comma seperated format as shown in the figure.

So lets first convert it into a proper excel format. For this I'm using Excel for proper data formatting.
